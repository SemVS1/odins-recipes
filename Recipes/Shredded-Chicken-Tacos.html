        <li>2 (8 ounce) cans Goya Tomato Sauce</li>

        <li>2 teaspoons Goya White Distilled Vinegar</li>    
            
        <li>2 teaspoons Goya Minced Garlic</li>    
            
        <li>3 ½ teaspoons ancho chile powder</li>    
            
        <li>1 teaspoon Goya Ground Cumin</li>    
            
        <li>2 teaspoons Goya Oregano Leaf</li>    
            
        <li>½ teaspoon sugar</li>    
            
        <li>2 tablespoons Goya Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>    
            
        <li>2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts</li>    
            
        <li>1 pinch Goya Adobo with Pepper, to taste</li>    
            
        <li>1 (10 ounce) package Goya Corn Tortillas, warmed</li>    
    </ul>
    <h2>For the garnish:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup finely chopped white onion</li>

        <li>1 lime, cut into wedges</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons coarsely chopped fresh cilantro</li>

        <li>1 dash Goya Hot Sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In medium bowl, mix together tomato sauce, vinegar, garlic, chili powder, cumin, oregano, and sugar. Season with Adobo; set aside.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat oil in large skillet over medium-high heat. Season chicken with Adobo. Cook chicken, turning once, until light golden brown on both sides, about 5 minutes. <br>
        Add reserved tomato sauce mixture to pan; bring to a boil (be careful, the tomato sauce can splatter). Lower heat to medium low. <br>
        Simmer, covered, until cooked through (thermometer will register 170 degrees F when inserted into thickest part of breast), flipping once, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Transfer chicken to cutting board; reserve sauce in pan. Remove and discard bones and skin. Using two forks, shred chicken breast. <br>
        Transfer chicken to skillet with sauce, mixing to combine; continue to cook until sauce reduces and blends into chicken, <br>
        and mixture begins to caramelize, about 10 minutes more.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Transfer chicken mixture to serving bowl. Spoon into warmed corn tortillas.<br>
        Garnish with lettuce, tomatoes, avocados and/or onions, if desired. Sprinkle with hot sauce, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
